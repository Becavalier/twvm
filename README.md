## Getting Started

### Status

Not production-ready yet, feel free to keep tracking the project status by clicking "Watch".

### Compile

If you want to compile and use this project, please install the following softwares in advance:

* [cmake v3.11 (or above)](https://cmake.org/install/)
* [nodejs v12.13.0 LTS (or above)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

then, run the following command to compile:

```
npm run build
```

### Others

* **Code Lint**:

We use "*cpplint*" to check the code style, you can install it by follow command:

`pip install cpplint`

And lint the source code by:

`npm run lint`

* **Memory Check**:

Install "*valgrind*" on MacOS according to the following articles first:

*[How to Install Valgrind on macOS High Sierra](https://www.gungorbudak.com/blog/2018/04/28/how-to-install-valgrind-on-macos-high-sierra/)*

*[Valgrind on macOs 10.14/10.15](https://github.com/sowson/valgrind)*


Then run the following command to detect the memory leak of the binary version program:

`npm run memcheck`
